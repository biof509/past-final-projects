    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A great deal of work has been conducted on facial expressions as they pertain to the basic emotions - but little work has bee done on facial expressions of pain. We know that facial expressions of pain occur as a social phenomenom (to get help from others and/or to evoke danger to others. But has the communication become automatic and universal? Does it track with intensity of pain (e.g., will you present more expression when you experience more pain?)? \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Hypotheses: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will be able to classify pain compared to non-pain trials in an acute pain paradigm\n",
    "2. The amount of pain someone reports will weakly correlate to the amount of facial movement they have (Rainville et al., under review, suggests that there are differences in how much people present with some individuals not expressing pain). \n"

    "1. We brought in healthy volunteers to undergo an acute pain paradigm while being filmed. \n",
    "2. Individuals experienced 64 trials of acute heat pain (10 sec durations) to the forearm and made two ratings:\n",
    "    a. pain or no pain\n",
    "    b. how intense the stimulation was 0-100 (separate for pain / no-pain; e.g., 0-200)\n",
    "3. Videos were filmed with a GoPro Hero 5 camera at 60 frames per second, affixed with a GoPro helmet to limit facial movements and underwent the following steps before data were analyzed:\n",
    "    a. raw videos were imported into Adobe Premiere Pro, downscaled to 80% to ensure the whole        face was present in the video and were rotated 270 degrees to be in the upright \n",

    "    c. videos were imported into iMotions video software to localize facial data within the \n",

    "       locations from a short baseline period\n",

    "Within the regressor learner, I looked at the peak performance of each of the different regressors (linear and non-linear) and identified peak performance for the amplitude based outcomes compared to the AUC outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greater predictability via amplitude compared to AUC may be due to the nature of facial expressions. Expressions are often not maintained for long periods. Instead, people make quick and large movements to an acute stimulus. This is being picked up well by the amplitude measure but are being watered down (if present) in the AUC measure. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our original hypotheses, how did we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "1. We will be able to classify pain compared to non-pain trials in an acute pain paradigm\n",
    "2. The amount of pain someone reports will weakly correlate to the amount of facial movement they have (Rainville et al., under review, suggests that there are differences in how much people present with some individuals not expressing pain).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to hypothesis 1), we found a supervised logistic regression based on our facial feature predictors was able to predict (above 95% accuracy) whether a trial was rated as painful or not. We did not find good classification by clustering (via KMeans) with our model - but did find 2 clusters as ideal from our elbow plot (as hypothesized via high and low expressors based on the literature). \n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to hypothesis 2) we found a weak and nearing moderate correlation between actual and predicted pain ratings from a linear based regression (with our facial feature predictors). This was expected and was actually a bit stronger than originally hypothesized due to individuals nature to suppress facial expressions. "
